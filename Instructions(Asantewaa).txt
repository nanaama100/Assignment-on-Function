Code Instrustion

1. In order to calculate for simple interest, principal, rate or time, all you need to
do is to import the si_calc python file into your vs code. The si_calc python file contains all
the functions to help you calculate for simple interest,principal, rate and time. 

2. Open your vs code app on your desktop or any place you have saved the app on your machine.

3. Create your own python file where you want your calculation to be performed and save it as name.py
#name is the name you want to give to your python file. 

4. In your python file type: from si_calc import Simple_Interest, Rate_in_SI, Principal_in_SI, Time_in_SI 
#the Simple_Interest is the function name to be called to calculate for simple interest. 
#the Rate_in_SI is the function name to be called to calculate for rate in simple interest. 
#the Principal_in_SI is the function name to be called to calculate for principal in simple interest. 
#the Time_in_SI is the function name to be called to calculate for time in simple interest. 

5. To calculate for the simple interest, call the function name, which is Simple_Interest by typing
it on the third line in your vs code after you have typed from si_calc import Simple_Interest, Rate_in_SI, Principal_in_SI, 
Time_in_SI which comes in the first line. 
The Simple_Interest takes three parameters(Principal, Rate, Time). The parameters serves as a placeholder for
the values to be passed to them. Here's an example below of how to pass the values to the parameters

Simple_Interest(1000, 0.5, 5)
#the 1000 is the value stored in the principal parameter
#the 0.5 is the value stored in the rate parameter
#the 5 is the value stored in the time parameter

6. Now you can call the function by typing the name of the function in your vs code with your own example values.

7. After that create a variable where you can store the result for your simple interest.
example: interest = Simple_Interest(1000, 0.5, 5)
the "interest" is my variable that stores the result, Simple_Interest

7. Afterwards you print the interest 
type: print("the simple interest is ", interest)

8. In order to calculate for your principal, repeat the same process as seen for the simple interest. Call 
the Principal function. The principla function takes 3 parameters(interest, rate , time) and repeat the 
steps in the simple interest in the same way after you pass in your values to the paramters. 

9. To calculate for rate, use the same procedure as seen for the simple interest. Call the rate function. The 
rate function also takes 3 parameters(Interest, Principal, Time) then pass your argment or values to the parameters
and repeat the steps in the simple interest in the same way after you pass in your values to the paramters. 

10. To calculate for time, use the same procedure as seen for the simple interest. Call the time function. The 
time function also takes 3 parameters(Interest, Principal, Rate) then pass your values and repeat the steps in 
the simple interest in the same way after you pass in your values to the paramters.
